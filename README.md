# Practicum Data Science

Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my studies at Practicum.

| Project | Description | Libraries  |
|:- |:- |:- |
|[Music valence prediction](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Music%20valence%20prediction/songValencePrediction-shallowModels.ipynb)| Predict song's valence using audio features. Takes an audio input and returns an estimated valence score with a 95% confidence interval. |*librosa, spotipy, beautifulsoup, catboost, lightgbm, xgboost, scikit-learn,  matplotlib, seaborn*|
|[Telecom churn prediction](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Telecom%20churn%20prediction/telecom-churn-prediction.ipynb)| Using machine learning methods methods discover patterns in customers' behavior and determin the factors that affect churn. |*tensorflow keras, catboost, sklearn, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy*|
|[Movie reviews classification](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Movie%20reviews%20classification/movie-reviews-classification.ipynb)| Preprocess text data and classificate reviews as positive or negative. | *torch, transformers, nltk, spacy, sklearn, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas*|
|[Age prediction by photo](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Age%20prediction%20by%20photo/age-prediction.ipynb)| Using ImageDataGenerator module built a `flow_from_directory` pipeline. Composed a script for the ResNet50 model training, uploaded and ran the model on the cloud-based GPU platform. | *tensorflow keras, ImageDataGen, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy*|
|[Car price prediction](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Car%20price%20prediction/car-price-prediction.ipynb)| Evaluated 5 models with hyperparameters tuning, estimated each model's average error, as well as training and prediction time. | *sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, catboost, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas* |
|[Phone plans analyzis](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/Phone%20plans%20analyzis/phone-plans-analyzis.ipynb)| Preprocessed and merged data from several datasets. Used data aggregation and custom functions to calculate revenue. On histograms, showed the difference in plans and users' behavior. Ran statistical tests to validate findings. | *scipy, matplotlib, pandas, numpy* |
| [Rental market consulting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sj9lkYIRb0SCa9LSPcjP-b8FuE46_gg5Jsu77bykhJM/edit?usp=sharing)| Using Airbnb data analyzed the vacation rental market in New York to provide data-driven guidance for potential investments. Also, I estimated annual income that could be generated by a property with optimal characteristics and location.  | *Google Sheets* |
